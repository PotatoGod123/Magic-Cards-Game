        <h2>Cristian Robles</h2>
        <p>I'm Cristian Robles, my prior work history was in retail so it’s an odd experience going from lifting heavy boxes to typing heavy code but being able to just program things out is something that really speaks to me and I greatly enjoy. Currently I’m student at Code Fellows studying Software Engineering and Development. At the moment mainly focused on JavaScript , HTML and CSS, while also become better with my skills, so I can hone my craft as I go forward with my career.So that I become a strong, efficient, and great developer and hopefully a colleague.</p>

        <h2>Nick Abramowicz</h2>
        <p class = "title"></p>
        <p>I am a software developer with a background in real estate acquisitions - primarily NNN commercial real estate and residential foreclosures. I have a proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I’m pursuing my goal to become an expert developer because of my passion for building.  I’ve always had a skill for building/construction whether that be physically or mentally. My previous experience has equipped me with strengths in building, communication, and working with a team which translate hand in hand to the coding world. I’m excited for the endless possibilities and projects that can be constructed conceptually with my mind and fingers.  </p>

        <h2>Seid Moahamed</h2>
        <p>Hi my name is Seid Mohamed, I came from the trucking business and also have an experience as a sales 
            Person. My previous experience of taking a database class back in 2018 gives me a boost to learn software development. Being great in finding solutions regardless of the situation makes me a good candidate as 
            software development is all about giving solutions to the society.</p>

        <h2>Wondwosen Tsige</h2>
        <p>A former limousine driver and current software development student.My inspiration to learn software development comes from a curiosity of knowing what is the logic behind a huge Management Information System project that I participated as an implementer and trainer. I am hoping to find a role as Artificial Intelligence Engineer because I strongly believe machines simulating human intelligence are the future of our world.</p>
